Apache Commons IO are Apache Commons components, 
which are derived from the Java API and provide 
various utility classes for common operations for File IO, 
covering a wide range of use cases. 
This helps to avoid writing the standard code.

1. IOUtilsExample (comparison with BufferedReader class)
2. IOFilesExample (working with Temp directory)
3. IOFilenameUtilsExample (working with filenames)
4. IOFileSystemUtils (get free space on disk)
5. IOCaseExample (check strings on equality)
